Understanding Ceph components
============================
ODSs: The storage unit where data is kept, as well as a daemon that interacts with the storage. Thousands of ODSs can exist in a cluster.
MONs: Provides access to ODSs.
MDS: Metadata server that manages the file system namespace.
Block device: rdb.
Gateway: rgw; RESTful interface to Ceph.
CephFS

Understanding ODSs
------------------
- The starage backend (hard disk) is made smart by OSD daemons
	Any block device with a file system that supports User Extended Attribute can be an OSD

- Every disk is an OSD and the number of OSDs is unlimited
- Note that the OSD is the block device, as well as the daemon that runs on top of it

Understanding MONs
------------------
- MONs handls cluster quorum to avoid split brain situations, using the PAXOS algorithm.
	Use on at least, 3-5 is recomended
- MONs keep track of all existing MONs and OSDs
- MONs are the initial point of contact for Ceph clients
	Clients upload to a primary OSD and the OSD calculates target OSDs for replicas, using the CRUSH algorithm

Understanding CURSH
-------------------
- CRUSH is Controlled Replication Under Scalable Hashing
- It is a pseudo-random algorithm that nesures that identical objects will always end up on the same OSDs if the topology of the cluster has not changed.
- Placement groups are used to write data to the OSDs.
- Administrators can manipulate CRUSH to determine where objects are written.

Authentication
-------------
- CephX is used as the authentication algorithm allowing users to access specific OSDs.
- Pools can be used to segregate the cluster into regions
